# Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots of the StockPortfolio app for the main README.

## How to add screenshots:

1. **Take screenshots** of the app running in the iOS Simulator
2. **Save them** with these exact names:
   - `portfolio.png` - Portfolio view showing total value and stock list
   - `discover.png` - Discover view showing search and watchlist
   - `analytics.png` - Analytics view showing charts and insights
3. **Replace** the placeholder files in this folder
4. **Recommended size**: 375x812 (iPhone 13/14/15 size) or similar

## Screenshot Guidelines:

- Use the iOS Simulator for consistent appearance
- Show the main content of each screen
- Ensure text is readable
- Use light mode for better visibility
- Crop to remove simulator chrome if desired

The screenshots will automatically appear in the main README.md file.
